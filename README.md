# Matrix library to solve linear system

This library can solve matrices stored in dense or sparse format. Dense matrix class is contained in `Matrix.h` and member functions are implemented in `Matrix.cpp`, while sparse matrix class is contained in `CSRMatrix.h` and member functions are implemented in `CSRMatrix.cpp`. 

The implemented solvers include:

1. Gauss-Seidel solver
2. Jacobi solver
3. LU decomposition

All 3 are implemented for dense matrices, and the first 2 are implemented for sparse matrices.

Compile and run `interface.cpp` to use the interface and linear solver.
