# Matrix library to solve linear system

This library can solve matrices stored in dense or sparse format. The implemented solvers include:

1. Gauss-Seidel solver
2. Jacobi solver
3. LU decomposition

All 3 are implemented for dense matrices, and the first 2 are implemented for sparse matrices.

Compile and run `interface.cpp` to use the interface and linear solver.
